# Probablistic Road Map (PRM)

### Author: Rico Jia

### Description
Probablistic Road Map provides nodes in unoccupied areas and edges that connect them. 
Due to the robot size, the nodes should be far from obstacles. 

 An implementation is shown below. The obstacles are marked in red, free paths are in blue, 
 and nodes are in yellow.
